# Amazon DynamoDB Asynchronous Java code examples

This README discusses how to run and test the Java Asynchronous code examples for Amazon DynamoDB.

## Running the Amazon DynamoDB Asynchronous Java files

**IMPORTANT**

The Java examples perform AWS operations for the account and AWS Region for which you've specified credentials, and you might incur AWS service charges by running them. See the [AWS Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/) for details about the charges you can expect for a given service and operation.   

To run these examples, you can setup your development environment to use Apache Maven or Gradle to configure and build AWS SDK for Java projects. For more information, 
see [Get started with the AWS SDK for Java 2.x](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/get-started.html). 


 ## Testing the DynamoDB Asynchronous Java files

You can test the Asynchronous Java code examples for Amazon DynamoDB by running a test file named **DynamoDBAsyncTest**. This file uses JUnit 5 to run the JUnit tests and is located in the **src/test/java** folder. For more information, see [https://junit.org/junit5/](https://junit.org/junit5/).

You can run the JUnit tests from a Java IDE, such as IntelliJ, or from the command line by using Maven. As each test is run, you can view messages that inform you if the various tests succeed or fail. For example, the following message informs you that Test 3 passed.

	Test 3 passed

**WARNING**: _Running these JUnit tests manipulates real Amazon DynamoDB resources and might incur charges on your account._

 ### Properties file
Before running the DynamoDB JUnit tests, you must define values in the **config.properties** file located in the **resources** folder. This file contains values that are required to run the JUnit tests. For example, you define a table name used for various tests. If you do not define all values, the JUnit tests fail.

Define these values to successfully run the JUnit tests:

- **tableName** - The name of an existing table. For example, **Music3**.
- **key** ??? The name of a key to use. For example, **Artist**.
- **keyValue** ??? The key value. For example, **Famous Band**.
- **newTableName** ??? The name of a new table to create.
- **newKey** ??? The name of a  new key.

### Command line
To run the JUnit tests from the command line, you can use the following command.

		mvn test

You will see output from the JUnit tests, as shown here.

### Unsuccessful tests

If you do not define the correct values in the properties file, your JUnit tests are not successful. You will see an error message such as the following. You need to double-check the values that you set in the properties file and run the tests again.
